# bingo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Android local.properties

This project now includes a placeholder `android/local.properties` file to
satisfy Gradle's `settings.gradle.kts` which expects a `flutter.sdk` entry.

You should update `android/local.properties` with paths that match your
machine. Example entries:

```
sdk.dir=C:/Users/YourUser/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk
flutter.sdk=C:/path/to/flutter
```

On Windows use forward slashes (`C:/...`) or escaped backslashes
(`C:\\path\\to\\flutter`). If you're using a CI system, it's better to
generate `local.properties` during the build rather than committing machine-
specific paths.
